                               CUSTOMIZING P@RDALYS
###############################################################################

By default p@rdalys will use the puppet configuration 
stored at

  $(datadir)/pardalys/etc/puppet.conf

and the manifest at

  $(datadir)/pardalys/manifests/kolab.pp

This will install and configure a default Kolab server based on the
puppet modules stored at

  $(datadir)/pardalys/modules/


If you want to customize the bahaviour of p@rdalys you have several
options.


1) Using a modified puppet.conf

   You can create your own puppet.conf file in

     /etc/pardalys/puppet.conf

   This gives you a lot of additional control over the different
   elements puppet will take into account. You can specify additional
   module paths or you could switch to a different type of node
   configuration.


2) Using a custom site.pp

   Instead of using the kolab.pp manifest delivered by p@rdalys you can
   of alternatively use your own manifest and place it in

     /etc/pardalys/site.pp

   This allows you to deviate from the main Kolab server configuration
   and enables you to hand pick the puppet modules you actually want to
   use for you setup.


3) Using p@rdalys in development mode

   You can also use the script 

     dev-pardalys

   to download the p@rdalys repository and install it in your machine at

     $(datadir)/pardalys/dev-pardalys/

   This will be a checkout of the master git repository kept at

     git://github.com/wrobel/pardalys.git

   Just downloading the master repository will not allow you to commit
   your changes though. If you want to actively contribute to the
   project you should got to

     http://github.com

   and create your own account there. Once you did that you can fork
   the master p@rdalys repository to your own account and check this
   out to you local machine using

     dev-pardalys -u MY_USER_NAME -s

   With this checkout you can commit your own changes back. Once you
   are satisfied with a set of modifications you can send a pull
   request to the p@rdalys master repository so that the changes can
   be included after review.
