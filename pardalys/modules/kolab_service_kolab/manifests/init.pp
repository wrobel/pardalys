        If you did not bootstrap the server yet you need to create

        Maybe you already bootstrapped the server, your LDAP server
        failed and you are unable to restart it. Then you can try to
        add the line \"slapd_recovery:true\" to $kolab_globalsfile and
        rerun p@rdalys to try to repair the LDAP configuration.
