This project is a hybrid EC2, Puppet & Portage management tool for
Gentoo Linux images.  With it you can build a Gentoo EC2 image from
scratch, bundle it up and send it to Amazon, start it, stop it and
terminate it.  All software management from the image stage to the
running instance (ongoing) is managed by Puppet.  Additionally there
is a portage overlay for packages helpful to running servers at ec2.

* - Fire up a pre-existing 2.6.18-compatible image - these are ok:
     m1.small, c1.medium            -> ami-d8a347b1 w/ aki-9b00e5f2
     m1.large, m1.xlarge, c1.xlarge -> ami-c8ac48a1 w/ aki-9800e5f1

* - Setup up ruby, rubygems, puppet & git on the server instance.

yum update -y
yum install ruby-devel rubygems git-core -y
rm -f ~/.gemrc
gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
gem update --system
gem update
gem install rake aws-s3 hpricot facter --no-rdoc --no-ri
gem clean

* - Clone this project to your server

git clone git://github.com/dysinger/gec2.git
cd gec2

* - Create your own env.yml file to house all your Amazon settings.
Mine looks like so:

* - Fire away! - This may take a couple hours as 100% of the OS is
compiled for the CPU and Architecture of the image type:

nohup rake -t image &
tail -f nohup.out

* - If all goes well you should have a nice fresh image for yourself
in a bucket all registered and ready to launch.
